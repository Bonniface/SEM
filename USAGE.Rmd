The `selected_columns` data frame provided contains four columns: `Piyg`, `Hloe`, `Waye`, and `Wiyar`. Each column represents different attributes or categories. Here's a brief description of each column:

**Piyg**: This column represents the gender of the individuals. It contains values such as "Male" and "Female".

**Hloe**: This column represents the highest level of education of the individuals. It includes categories like "High School or below", "Bachelor", and "Diploma".

**Waye**: This column represents the employment status of the individuals. It includes categories such as "Unemployed" and "Public Sector".

**Wiyar**: This column represents the age range of the individuals. It includes categories like "40-49 years", "50 years and above", "21-29 years", and so on.

**TMRSietu:** This column represents the individual rating if the Mobile Renewal Service is easy to use

Convert all columns except the first to factors

To assign survey questions to corresponding latent variables as indicators and determine appropriate measurement models, we need more information about the nature of the survey questions. The type of measurement model (binary, ordinal, or continuous) depends on the scaling and response options of each question.

```{r,results='asis'}
# Convert all columns except the first to factors
USAGE[, -1] <- lapply(USAGE[, -1], as.factor)

```

## Analysis

1.  Define latent variables:

    Latent Variable 1: Awareness and Perception of Mobile Renewal Service

```{r}
# Specify the latent variable names
latent_vars <- c("Awareness", "Benefits", "Usability", "Accessibility", "Trust")




```

## Modelling

2.  Define measurement model:

    -   Assign survey questions to corresponding latent variables as indicators. For example, question 2 will be an indicator of the Gender latent variable, question 3 will be an indicator of the Education Level latent variable, and so on. Assign appropriate measurement models (e.g., binary, ordinal, or continuous) based on the nature of the survey questions.

```{r}
# Specify the indicator names for each latent variable
indicators <- list(
  Awareness = c("NHIS_Mobile_Renewal_Awareness", "Previous_Mobile_Renewal_Use", "Mobile_Renewal_Rating", "Mobile_Renewal_Continuation_Opinion"),
  Benefits = c("Mobile_Renewal_Speed_Efficiency", "Mobile_Renewal_Time_Resource_Savings", "Mobile_Renewal_Effectiveness", "Mobile_Renewal_Productivity"),
  Usability = c("Mobile_Renewal_Ease_of_Use", "Mobile_Renewal_Benefits_Awareness", "Mobile_Renewal_Mobile_Money_Access", "Mobile_Renewal_Service_Usefulness"),
  Accessibility = c("Mobile_Renewal_Service_Accessibility", "Mobile_Renewal_Service_Disruptions", "Mobile_Renewal_Service_Availability", "Mobile_Renewal_Service_Reliability"),
  Trust = c("Mobile_Renewal_Service_Authenticity", "Trust_Telecom_Operators", "Mobile_Renewal_Service_Data_Security", "Mobile_Renewal_Service_Satisfaction")
  # Affordability = c("Q38", "Q39", "Q40", "Q41")
)

# Specify the relationships between latent variables based on theoretical expectations
model <- "
  # Latent variable definitions
  Awareness =~ NHIS_Mobile_Renewal_Awareness + Previous_Mobile_Renewal_Use + Mobile_Renewal_Rating + Mobile_Renewal_Continuation_Opinion
  Benefits =~ Mobile_Renewal_Speed_Efficiency + Mobile_Renewal_Time_Resource_Savings + Mobile_Renewal_Effectiveness + Mobile_Renewal_Productivity
  Usability =~ Mobile_Renewal_Ease_of_Use + Mobile_Renewal_Benefits_Awareness + Mobile_Renewal_Mobile_Money_Access + Mobile_Renewal_Service_Usefulness
  Accessibility =~ Mobile_Renewal_Service_Accessibility + Mobile_Renewal_Service_Disruptions + Mobile_Renewal_Service_Availability + Mobile_Renewal_Service_Reliability
  Trust =~ Mobile_Renewal_Service_Authenticity + Trust_Telecom_Operators + Mobile_Renewal_Service_Data_Security + Mobile_Renewal_Service_Satisfaction
  
  
  # Affordability =~ Q38 + Q39 + Q40 + Q41

  # Relationships between latent variables
  Awareness ~ AgeRange + Gender + Education + Employment

  # Residual variances

"
```

2.  Define structural model:

    -   Specify the relationships between latent variables based on theoretical expectations. For example, we hypothesize that Age Range, Gender,Education Level ,Employment Status affects or influences awareness of the Mobile Renewal Service.

        ![](images/UCLA.Path.Diagram.png)

        ```{r}
        # install.packages("lavaan")
        library(lavaan)

        # Fit the SEM model to the data
        fit <- sem(model, data = USAGE, ordered = TRUE)

        # Summarize the results
        summary(fit)
        ```

3.  Estimate the model:

    -   Use SEM software (such as lavaan, AMOS, or Mplus) to estimate the model parameters. The software will provide estimates for factor loadings, regression coefficients, and latent variable variances and covariances.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

```

## Model Evaluation

5.  Assess model fit:

    -   Evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model using fit indices such as the chi-square test, Comparative Fit

```{r}

```
